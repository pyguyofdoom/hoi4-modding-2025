restoration_of_the_eastafrican_mandate_desc:0 "Why the fuck do both of these assholes have the same name. Regardless, this Foumis made much less of a fuss, and only manged to piss off a third of the population instead of half. Let us bring him back into the fold. "
thelibyandebaclesolved:0 "The Libyan debacle, solved"
thelibyandebaclesolved_desc:0 "While governor-general Foumis is an excellent general, he is a damn terrible administrator. Suadense rebels almost made it to Halaib before we were able to mobilize troops. With the crisis resolved, we can bring back responsible administration to Sudan. "
patriarchs:0 "Patriarchs of the Hellenes"
patriarchs_desc:0 "Our patriarchs extol the great works of our hellenic past, and are a great boon to our national identity. However, many in the church have excerted their influence to fight our warmongering ways. Unfortunately for them, the time of demokracy is long past."
suez_need:0 "The Suez Revolt"
suez_need_desc:0 "The Suez is a shining beacon of our might, but is a current blight on our reputation. Communist rebels took control of Alexandria just a few years ago, and since then have blocked ships from passing through. We must reclaim the region quickly." 
colonial_corruption:0 "Corrupt Army"
colonial_corruption_desc:0 "With recent revolts depriving us of most native corps officers, we have had to make do with inexperienced and easily swayed leadership. These issues should pass given time. If we have time."

malaya_category_desc:0 "Our vassals have existed for nearly 500 years, but times are changing. We must unite to face outward threats to our state!"
westvassals:0 "Reigning in the West"
westvassals_desc:0 "The western tributaries are weak, but fiercely independent. In the past they were funded wholesale by Mongol and Cambodian rivals, but that time is long gone. Without foreign backing their rulers will have no choice but to bow." 
eastvassals:0 "Reigning in the East" 
eastvassals_desc:0 "Sunda and Australia have always been loyal, but their territories are massive. Sunda controls the old regional capitol in Java, while Australia nearly outnumbers us in population! It will not be a challenge to ask these leaders for their submission, however, it will be challenging to keep their land under control. "

#putting india stuff here because fuck you 
india_stronk:0 "Nearly United, and Ready"
india_stronk_desc:0 "The national revolution was a success! After kicking out our Holy Roman opressors, we proclaimed the first provisional government, declaring total war on all colonizers left in the subcontinent. One great war later and we have nearly done it. There are only a few holdouts now, with the celts holding on for dear life to the east, and our great rivals of Transcaucasia to the north. Our rivals may be strong, but we did not come this far to falter now. Glory to the emperor, and to a free India!"

mountain_men:0 "The GSOC"
mountain_men_desc:0 "The endless mountains we inhabit are the perfect place to train the next generation of hero. Throughout our history, our people have chosen to use these mountains as the backdrop to wage defensive wars of attrition. No more. In an age of rolling steel and thunder from above, we will go on the offense with the meanest and greenest special forces corps on earth."

najera_beatdown:0 "Najera on the offense"
najera_beatdown_desc:0 "The state of Najera has existed as a buffer state between our own and that of the Celts for over 600 years. Leon-Castile has been the site of many great battles against catholic crusaders in the past, and even today remnants of the old holy orders remain in the mountains. Sensing our weakness, the Najerans have rallied to assault us one last time, possibly with Celtic support from abroad."
catalonia_beatdown:0 "The last Iberians" 
catalonia_beatdown_desc:0 "The Catalonian state is an anomaly in Europe. While in most other regions resistance by the native peoples died out long ago, in Catalonia this resistance is stronger than ever. Rebels rally to the cause daily against hungry Occitanian and Basque invaders. This revanchist regime must be put down, before they put us down!"

Hatewestindies:0 "§RUndying §RHatred"
Hatewestindies_desc:0 "Our relations with the West Indies have been strained at the best of times. Rivals under colonial empires, rivals after independence, rivals after the 3d time they blocked our rightful annexation of Louisiana. They cannot seem to leave us alone on the continent, and our people grow restless at the constant intervention. The West Indies must be taught a lesson in respect."
Commierun:0 "Leftist Haven"
Commierun_desc:0 "With most communist regimes around the world being toppled, the majority of great communist intellectuals have fled here to the US. Our nation has become a beacon of hope for leftist pariahs everywhere, even if we are a simple democracy. This has also allowed communist brigades-in-exile to form, boosting both our officer corps and fledgling military." 
Navalbuildup:0 "Naval Buildup"
