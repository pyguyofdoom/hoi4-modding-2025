restoration_of_the_eastafrican_mandate_desc:0 "Why the fuck do both of these assholes have the same name. Regardless, this Foumis made much less of a fuss, and only manged to piss off a third of the population instead of half. Let us bring him back into the fold. "
thelibyandebaclesolved:0 "The Libyan debacle, solved"
thelibyandebaclesolved_desc:0 "While governor-general Foumis is an excellent general, he is a damn terrible administrator. Suadense rebels almost made it to Halaib before we were able to mobilize troops. With the crisis resolved, we can bring back responsible administration to Sudan. "

india_stronk_desc:0 "The national revolution was a success! After kicking out our Holy Roman opressors, we proclaimed the first provisional government, declaring total war on all colonizers left in the subcontinent. One great war later and we have nearly done it. There are only a few holdouts now, with the celts holding on for dear life to the east, and our great rivals of Transcaucasia to the north. Our rivals may be strong, but we did not come this far to falter now. Glory to the emperor, and to a free India!"

In an age of rolling steel and thunder from above, we will go on the offense with the meanest and greenest special forces corps on earth."
