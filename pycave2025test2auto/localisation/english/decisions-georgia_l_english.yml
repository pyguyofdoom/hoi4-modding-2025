mongol_invasion_desc:0 "With their backs to the door, the Ipaosids have rallied every last warrior left in the state to sally out against us! Those vultures are only able to pick a fight with us when we are at our weakest, expect them to strike after those damn rebels to the south begin their assault."

brothers_war_desc:0 "Different in culture and ideology, the countries of Bahrein, Ardalan, and Transcaucasia have lived in harmony for some time now. Other than the ocassional massacre we stage. Still, we were shocked to hear that Bahrein and Ardalan were conspiring against us, and just last month they stopped sending tribute. This cannot stand! We will crush the insurgents, and bring democratic freedom once more to the middle east."
